# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Introduction

Vite is a next-generation frontend tooling that is fast and lean, built on top of native ES module imports and optimized for modern browsers. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

This template combines the power of Vite and React, allowing developers to quickly set up a modern development environment for React projects.

## Features

- **Vite**: Vite is used as the build tool, providing instant server start and fast hot module replacement.
- **React**: The React library is integrated into the project, enabling developers to build dynamic user interfaces.
- **Fast Refresh**: Two official plugins are available for Fast Refresh:
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react`: Uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
  - `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
- **ESLint**: ESLint is set up with some basic rules to ensure code quality and consistency.
- **Markdown Support**: This README file is written in Markdown format, making it easy to read and edit.
